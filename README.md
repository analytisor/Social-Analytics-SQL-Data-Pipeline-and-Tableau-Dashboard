### **Project Summary**

**Challenge:**  
ASPIRE was at risk of losing a key client due to inadequate day-to-day reporting in its main reporting panel. Without actionable insights, client satisfaction and retention were in jeopardy.

**Solution:**  
I conducted an analysis in SQL to uncover insights on creator types, sign-up registrations, and campaign performance. Over six weeks, I independently audited the company's legacy data sources, revised the data model, ensured accuracy in new data pipelines, and built a Tableau dashboard to visualize trends related to Content Deliverable Status, Post Types, Creator Types, and Engagement Types. The insights and recommendations were aimed at the retail and marketing teams to improve day-to-day campaign performance and creator selections.

**Impact:**  
- **Client Renewal:** The improved reporting capabilities led to a successful agreement renewal with the client.  
- **Internal Recognition:** My work resulted in integration with ASPIREâ€™s engineering team, where I audited data pipelines in BigQuery and took on additional data visualization responsibilities.

### **Metrics and Dimensions**

**Key Metrics:**
- Count of Creators  
- Count of Content  
- Impressions  
- Engagement (Likes, Comments, Saves, Shares)  
- Engagement Rate (%)

**Key Dimensions:**
- Creator Tiers (Macro, Micro, Mid-Tier, Nano)  
- Deliverable Types (LIVE, Approved, Content Review, Locked)  
- Network (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube)  
- Activation Types (New vs. Returning)  
- Campaign Name  
- Mall Locations  
- Date Shortcuts (This Week, Last Week, This Month, Last Month, etc.)  
- Chart Timeframes (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Annually)

### **Summary of Insights**

- **Engagement Per Post:** Despite a 45% increase in 'LIVE' creators between June 2024 and March 2024 and a steady number of posts per creator (1.16 vs. 1.15), there has been a significant 70%+ drop in engagement per post. This decline is primarily attributed to creators on TikTok.
- **Instagram Mid-Tier Creators:** Although Mid-Tier creators on Instagram made up less than 10% of all creators for the network in the first six months of 2024, their engagement rate of 5.85% far exceeds that of Micro and Nano influencers, generating over 7X more engagements than Nano and Micro creators combined.

### **Recommendation and Next Steps**

- **Investigate Creator Segments and Content Strategy:** Explore whether the issue lies in the recruitment of creators or the content strategy being promoted.
- **Micro-Tier Creator Budget Allocation:** Examine the content niches and diversification of Micro-Tier creators. Consider dedicating more budget toward this segment, as they are more affordable and could offer a higher return.
- **Expand Visualizations:** Continue expanding the dashboard to include more in-depth visualizations across different performance aspects, including post breakdowns, locations, and more.





**INFLUENCER MARKTING ANALYTICS QUERY**

This SQL query is designed to create a comprehensive view of social media campaign performance, aggregating data from various sources and performing complex calculations. The view, named adhoc.nexus_mart_view_s, incorporates several advanced SQL techniques such as the use of common table expressions (CTEs), conditional calculations, string pattern matching with regular expressions, and the UNION function to combine different segments of data.

Key Features

**Total Media Value (TMV) Calculation:** Calculates the TMV for different social media networks using a custom formula.
Regular Expressions: Uses regex to identify mall locations from post captions.

**UNION ALL:** Combines live and non-live member data into a single dataset.
Creator Status and Tier Calculation: Determines the status and tier of content creators based on their activity and follower count.
Steps Explained

**Calculate Live Members:** Identifies and categorizes live members from the bi.mention and bi.member tables.
Daily Aggregates: Aggregates daily post performance metrics for live members, including impressions, likes, comments, etc. It also calculates TMV based on network-specific formulas.

**Approved Members:** Retrieves a list of approved members and excludes live members from this list to identify non-live approved members.

**Content Reviews:** Filters content reviews for non-live members to identify their current status.

**Combine Data:** Merges data from live members and other creator statuses into a single dataset using UNION ALL.

**Social Account Data:** Enriches the combined data with social account details.

**Campaign and Mall Location:** Adds campaign names and mall locations based on regex matches in post captions.
